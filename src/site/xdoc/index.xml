<section name="Commons Lang">

<p>
The standard Java libraries fail to provide enough methods for
manipulation of its core classes. Apache Commons Lang provides
these extra methods.
</p>

<p>
Lang provides a host of helper utilities for the java.lang API, notably
String manipulation methods, basic numerical methods, object reflection, concurrency, creation and serialization
and System properties. Additionally it contains basic enhancements to java.util.Date and a series of utilities dedicated to help with
building methods, such as hashCode, toString and equals.
</p>
<p>
Note that Lang 3.0 (and subsequent versions) use a different package (<em>org.apache.commons.lang3</em>) than the previous versions (<em>org.apache.commons.lang</em>), allowing it to be used at the same time as an earlier version.
</p>

The <a href="mail-lists.html">commons developer mailing list</a> is the main channel of communication for contributors. Please remember that the lists are shared between all commons components, so prefix your email by [lang]. </p>
<p>You can also visit the #apache-commons IRC channel on irc.freenode.net or peruse <a href="issue-tracking.html">JIRA</a>. Specific links of interest for JIRA are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas looking for code: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20LANG%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Patch%20Needed%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC">Patch Needed</a></li>
<li>Issues with patches, looking for reviews: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Review%20Patch%22%20AND%20project%20%3D%20LANG%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC">Review Patch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively you can go through the <em>Needs Work</em> tags in the <a href="taglist.html">TagList report</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to offer up pull requests via GitHub rather than applying patches to JIRA, we have a <a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/">GitHub mirror</a>. </p>
